# Jade.php
Will be adding all my changes to https://github.com/cyonite/phade/ ended up converting a lot of stuff from original jade project. Nothing will really remain.
You can see test results on http://phade.io/

Jade.php adds inline PHP scripting support to the [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) template compiler.

## Implementation details

The fork is a complete rewrite, all the code is ported from the original jade project.

All the features from the original are supported but undertested, including inheritance
and mixins.
